PhyStar is a numerical package designed to help physical scientists simulate and analyse physical phenomena with a wide range of applications. PhyStar has now supported particle-laden flows in
- Analytical flow:TGV, Shear flow
- Homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT): Quasi-spectral method
- Turbulent channel flow (TCF): Quasi-spectral and differential methods
